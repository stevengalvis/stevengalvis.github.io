There is a right and a wrong way to learn how to code. This is a brief story of what not to do. I first wanted to get into SEO because of my marketing background. Then I heard to be good at SEO you need to know HTML so I picked up HTML. I thought it was boring and thought hey making Apps looks cool so I ended up learning a little bit of Android and then Objective-C. 

I dabbled with a few other technolgies and never stuck with anything for longer than 6 months. Coding was hard but I was going about it the wrong way. Here is what my journey has looked like so far

1. SEO
2. HTML/CSS
3. Started Android course on coursera creating playful apps(none coding but still hard)
4.Objective-C BNR was way too hard for beginner
5.Treehouse(HTML/CSS) did not finish intro got bored
6.Java(For Dummies started and gave up after 3rd chapter)
7.Swift(ThinkFul) wasted 1k big fail
8.Java For Dummies(Finished)
9.Beginning Java Objects 1/4th of way (890 page book)
10.Android App development intro on Udacity- finished
11. Java Treehouse almost finished halfway through Java Data structures
12. Java Code Academy-Completed
13. Android Sunshine App course(Mobile App) gave up when backend coding kicked in
14. Big Nerd Ranch Android.. did not complete did 5 chapters
15. Head First Android DNF- gave up at Fragment section
//Javascript and Treehouse/Front-End Masters/Big NR
16.Back to Treehouse Front-End track almost done
17.Front End Maters JS crash course
18.Big Nerd Ranch Front-End Book
19. Signed up for Flatiron Communuty Driven Bootcamp

It was fun to explore programming languages and different dev tools but now I'm ready to become a full stack developer.
